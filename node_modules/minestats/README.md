## Package Usage

### Username to UUID

By gain the **UUID** from the **username** you can use this function with the Minecraft username of a player. It will return an object with the `name` and `id` which is the `Minecraft UUID` of the player.
```js
UsernameToUUID('HalloSouf').then(info => {
    console.log(info);
});
```
Ouput:
```json
{
    "name": "HalloSouf",
    "id": "4da5c3b5966842aa9da0a43a4e9d4f0f"
}
```

### Server information

You can access Minecraft server information by using the `ServerStats` function. Enter your Server IP, and it will return some useful information you can use in your Node.js application. Besides that, you can enter your server port as wel like `play.turtlemc.net:25565`.
```js
ServerStats('play.turtlemc.nl').then(info => {
    console.log(info);
});
```

### Minecraft skins

For now you can only gain the skin pictures with the following functions:
```js
HeadAvatar('4da5c3b5966842aa9da0a43a4e9d4f0f').then(info => {
    console.log(info);
});

AvatarRendered('4da5c3b5966842aa9da0a43a4e9d4f0f').then(info => {
    console.log(info);
});

SkinRendered('4da5c3b5966842aa9da0a43a4e9d4f0f').then(info => {
    console.log(info);
});
```
It will return a link to the Minecraft skin.

*The next update will provide using `usernames` to gain the Minecraft player skin.*
